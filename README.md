# Deep Learning Notes

Personal prototypes and representative code on some Deep Learning problems with Tensorflow/Keras.

WARNING: pre-alpha state. Use and distribute on your own terms.

Topics covered:

- Using high-level interfaces of Tensorflow/Keras
- Using low(er)-level interfaces of Tensorflow/Keras
- Data inspection (e.g. for class imbalance)
- Data preprocessing & splits (simple)
- Simple sequential topologies
- Graph-based topologies (using functional API)
- Residual connections, Dropout, Batch Normalization
- Multi-Headed (Self-)Attention (using low-level Tensorflow APIs)
- Training with k-fold cross-validation
- Evaluation, metrics and simple visualization
